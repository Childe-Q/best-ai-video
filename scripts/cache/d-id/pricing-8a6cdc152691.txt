		When you create a video, the duration is deducted from the total minutes available in your plan. The length of the video is rounded up to the nearest 15-second interval. For example, a 1-minute and 10-second video will consume 1 minute and 15 seconds.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		Minutes do not accumulate, they are renewed every month and unused minutes become void.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		1. Click the menu on the bottom left and click “Billing”
2. Click the pen icon and change the details.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		It is important for us, as a company that enables users to create AI-based content, that there is transparency about the synthetic nature of the videos they generate. This is also reflected in our ethical manifesto, available at https://www.d-id.com/ethics/. Note, a full-screen watermark appears for trial users.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		To cancel your subscription, go to “Billing” > “Cancel plan”

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		If you’d like to delete your account, please contact support@d-id.com. Deleting your account will remove your access to D-ID, along with all your generated or translated videos, Agents, and stored data. If you decide to return, you can sign up again, but your previous data cannot be recovered.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		You can switch from a monthly to a yearly plan anytime by simply choosing an annual plan. There’s no need to contact support.
Similarly, you can also switch from a yearly to a monthly plan and the update will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		If you cancel your subscription, your plan will remain active until the end of the current billing period. Afterward, your account will be downgraded. As a free user, if you do not use D-ID for 6 months, your data will be deleted, but we will notify you via email before this happens.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		Login to D-ID, go to your Account page, and generate your API key.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		Minutes used via the API are deducted from the same balance as your web version of D-ID.

	

													
									
							
											
						
	

					
											
							
		API documentation is available at the Developer Hub.

		“As a Conversational AI provider, by using D-ID technology we’re able to showcase our value proposition of having a live conversation
with a generated photorealistic person in real-time using a neural voice across different channels (web and app). D-ID’s API is well
documented and the D-ID technical team was very supportive during the implementation phase.”

perfectly aligns with our focus on Social Emotional Learning (SEL), adding an emotionally resonant layer to the learning environment.
We couldn’t have asked for a better partner in pioneering the future of English learning.”
