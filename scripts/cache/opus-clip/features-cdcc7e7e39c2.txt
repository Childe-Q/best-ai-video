How does OpusClip work?OpusClip leverages big data to analyze your video content in relation to the latest social and marketing trends from major platforms, and generates a comprehensive understanding of your video for a data-driven decision on content repurposing. It then picks the highlighting moments of your long video, rearranges them into a viral-worthy short and polishes it with dynamic captions, AI-relayout, smooth transition to ensure that the clip is coherent and attention-grabbing, and ends with a strong call-to-action.
