--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total FAQs: 10
Source: tools.json content.reviews.faqs

1. Q: Is InVideo AI completely free to use?
   A: Yes—you can try it on the free plan, but exports are watermarked and usage is capped. Treat it as a workflow trial, not a plan for publishing consistently.

2. Q: Do edits consume credits in InVideo?
   A: Often, yes—users report that regenerating scenes or making certain changes can deduct minutes/credits, not just the first generation. If you iterate heavily, track usage closely and finalize your script before regenerating. [NEED VERIFICATION]

3. Q: Can I monetize InVideo AI videos on YouTube?
   A: Usually, monetization is safest on paid tiers where commercial terms are clearer. For client work or resale, double-check your plan's licensing and the stock asset terms before publishing.

4. Q: Can I use InVideo stock footage commercially?
   A: It depends on your plan and the asset source (premium libraries are typically tiered and capped). If you're publishing ads or client work, confirm the plan's commercial/resale coverage in the official terms/help docs.

5. Q: How to remove InVideo watermark without paying?
   A: You can't remove the watermark on the free plan—watermark removal is a paid feature. If you need publishable exports, you'll need a paid tier or a tool with a no-watermark free policy.

6. Q: What browsers work best with InVideo?
   A: Chrome tends to be the safest choice for editing and exports. Some users report playback/export issues on Firefox, especially on longer projects.

7. Q: Why do my exports fail at 99% completion?
   A: This is commonly reported with longer timelines or heavy assets. Try exporting in Chrome, splitting long videos into shorter segments, and reducing effects/overlays before re-exporting.

8. Q: What happens if I cancel?
   A: Exported videos generally remain usable, but your editing access and monthly credits can change after cancellation. If you're mid-project, export final versions before your billing period ends.

9. Q: InVideo AI vs. InVideo Studio: Which one do I need?
   A: InVideo AI is prompt-to-video (fast drafts with automated scenes and assets). Studio is more template/manual editing—better if you want hands-on control.

10. Q: Is InVideo legit or a scam?
   A: The product is widely used, but complaints often focus on unclear credit burn and frustrating cancellation/refund experiences. If you're unsure, start monthly first and keep an eye on usage and renewal settings.
