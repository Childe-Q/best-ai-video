            "question": "Can I use InVideo stock footage commercially?",

    "long_review": "<p>Zebracat has emerged as one of the most exciting AI video tools for marketers and creators in 2025. What sets it apart is its laser focus on <strong>viral social media content</strong>. Unlike generic video generators, Zebracat is built from the ground up to create videos that perform exceptionally well on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.</p><p>The platform's <strong>lightning-fast generation</strong> is a game-changer. While competitors take minutes or even hours to render videos, Zebracat delivers high-quality outputs in seconds. This speed advantage is crucial for marketers who need to capitalize on trending topics or create content on tight deadlines.</p><p>One of Zebracat's standout features is its <strong>music and effects synchronization</strong>. The AI automatically matches background music to your video's pacing and mood, creating a cohesive viewing experience that keeps audiences engaged. The natural AI voices sound remarkably human-like, eliminating the robotic tone that plagues many text-to-speech tools.</p><p>For brands, Zebracat's <strong>easy branding tools</strong> make it simple to maintain consistent visual identity across all videos. You can upload logos, brand colors, and fonts that automatically apply to every video you create. The free plan is generous enough for testing, though serious creators will want the paid plan for unlimited videos and advanced features.</p>",
