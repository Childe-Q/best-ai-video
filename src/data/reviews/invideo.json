  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "Is InVideo AI completely free to use?",
      "a": "Yes—you can try it on the free plan, but exports are watermarked and usage is capped. Treat it as a workflow trial, not a plan for publishing consistently.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "Do edits consume credits in InVideo?",
      "a": "Often, yes—users report that regenerating scenes or making certain changes can deduct minutes/credits, not just the first generation. If you iterate heavily, track usage closely and finalize your script before regenerating.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I monetize InVideo AI videos on YouTube?",
      "a": "Usually, monetization is safest on paid tiers where commercial terms are clearer. For client work or resale, double-check your plan's licensing and the stock asset terms before publishing.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use InVideo stock footage commercially?",
      "a": "It depends on your plan and the asset source (premium libraries are typically tiered and capped). If you're publishing ads or client work, confirm the plan's commercial/resale coverage in the official terms/help docs.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "How to remove InVideo watermark without paying?",
      "a": "You can't remove the watermark on the free plan—watermark removal is a paid feature. If you need publishable exports, you'll need a paid tier or a tool with a no-watermark free policy.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "What browsers work best with InVideo?",
      "a": "Chrome tends to be the safest choice for editing and exports. Some users report playback/export issues on Firefox, especially on longer projects.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "Why do my exports fail at 99% completion?",
      "a": "This is commonly reported with longer timelines or heavy assets. Try exporting in Chrome, splitting long videos into shorter segments, and reducing effects/overlays before re-exporting.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if I cancel?",
      "a": "Exported videos generally remain usable, but your editing access and monthly credits can change after cancellation. If you're mid-project, export final versions before your billing period ends.",
      "confidence": "confirmed"
    }
