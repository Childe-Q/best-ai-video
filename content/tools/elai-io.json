    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Do Free plan videos have a watermark?",
        "answer": "Yes—watermark-free videos are stated as available for paid accounts. That implies Free plan outputs include a visible watermark."
      },
      {
        "question": "What export resolution does Elai support?",
        "answer": "Pricing states Creator exports 1080p Full HD and Team supports 4K Ultra HD. Free/Creator 1080p vs Team/Enterprise 4K is plan-dependent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do unused minutes roll over month to month?",
        "answer": "No—official plan documentation says unused minutes expire at the end of the billing cycle. If rollover matters, monthly subscriptions may feel wasteful."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do annual plans handle minutes?",
        "answer": "Official documentation says annual subscriptions receive all minutes upfront. That can fit users who need bursts of production rather than steady monthly use."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes—help docs describe canceling via profile settings under Manage Subscriptions. Effects timing (immediate vs end-of-term) needs verification."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the refund policy?",
        "answer": "Terms do state paid services can be cancelled without refund in specific misuse cases. Clear consumer-friendly refund window needs verification from official terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Elai allowed for commercial use?",
        "answer": "The terms excerpt provided grants a license for personal, non-commercial use. Whether paid plans grant commercial rights needs verification from official Elai documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What stock media is included?",
        "answer": "Pricing indicates access to a variety of royalty-free images, videos, icons, and shapes. Specific providers need verification from official docs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What format do exported videos download as?",
        "answer": "MP4 downloads are reported by third-party sources. Official Elai confirmation for MP4 export wording needs verification."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a powerful computer to use Elai?",
        "answer": "Elai is presented as web-based and only requires a computer and internet connection. Specific hardware/RAM recommendations are not confirmed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some users complain about slow rendering?",
        "answer": "User reports: even short videos can take several minutes to render in some tests. Expect variability and plan buffer time for deadlines."
      },
      {
        "question": "How expressive are the avatars (gestures/movement)?",
        "answer": "User reports: avatars may have limited gestures and mostly neck-up movement. If you need body language, test your target style before committing."
