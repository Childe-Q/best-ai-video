    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does the Free plan include a watermark?",
        "answer": "Yes—Free plan outputs include branding watermarks, and paid tiers remove them. Watermark behavior should be verified on official pricing if you need certainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many credits does the Free plan include?",
        "answer": "The Free plan includes 25 credits monthly, roughly equal to about 5 minutes of video. Treat this as plan guidance rather than a precise production guarantee."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is export resolution 1080p or 4K available?",
        "answer": "Available evidence only mentions HD output in user reviews. Confirm exact resolution options in official plan documentation before buying."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file formats can I export?",
        "answer": "MP4 and MOV are referenced as correct formats for video files. Verify the complete export format list and whether audio-only exports exist."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel anytime, and what happens when I do?",
        "answer": "Once cancellation is initiated, the subscription ends immediately. Remaining paid time is not refunded."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do they offer refunds?",
        "answer": "No refunds are provided for subscription periods already paid. If refunds matter, confirm directly in official terms before subscribing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are commercial rights included?",
        "answer": "Many platforms grant commercial licenses on paid tiers. Check Zebracat's official terms for the exact license scope."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it include royalty-free stock media?",
        "answer": "Reviews describe access to millions of premium stock clips, images, and music tracks. Verify the exact providers, licensing terms, and any plan limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can it convert blog posts to video?",
        "answer": "An NLP workflow analyzes text and generates a script for video creation. The quality of results may still require manual edits."
      },
      {
        "question": "What features are exclusive to higher-tier plans?",
        "answer": "Voice cloning may be available only on higher tiers. Verify which plan includes it and any usage limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some users say it's expensive in credits?",
        "answer": "User reports: creating videos can take too many credits and may yield fewer outputs than competitors. Your mileage will depend on video length and generation settings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it stable and easy to customize?",
        "answer": "User reports: you may run into bugs or hiccups, and customization options can feel limited. If your workflow needs frame-level control, test thoroughly before upgrading."
