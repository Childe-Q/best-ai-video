The trade-off is cost: free exports are watermarked at 720p, and removing watermarks or accessing higher resolutions requires a paid plan plus re-exporting.

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Do free exports include a watermark?",
        "answer": "Yes—exports made on a free account have a visible VEED.IO watermark. If you need no watermark, you must export again on a paid plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "What export resolution do plans support?",
        "answer": "Official help states Free exports in 720p only, Lite up to 1080p, and Pro/Enterprise up to 4K. Your available export options depend on your plan tier."
      },
      {
        "question": "What formats can I export?",
        "answer": "You can export projects as MP4, MP3 (audio-only), or GIF. Choose the format at download time."
      },
      {
        "question": "If I upgrade, can I remove the watermark from an old video?",
        "answer": "You can remove it only by exporting the original project again after upgrading. Upgrading does not retroactively change already-exported files."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the refund policy work?",
        "answer": "Refunds are considered case-by-case under the terms of sale. Pro-rata refunds are referenced specifically if VEED ends the contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is VEED usable for commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Commercial rights typically come with paid subscriptions. Check official VEED terms for definitive coverage for your use case."

        "question": "Does VEED include stock audio/video?",
        "answer": "Paid plans may include access to stock media libraries. Verify current plan features on the official pricing page."
      },
      {
        "question": "What browser or system is recommended?",
        "answer": "VEED is browser-based. Modern browsers like Chrome are recommended for best performance and feature compatibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I cancel to stop future renewals?",
        "answer": "Manage auto-renewal settings in your workspace billing dashboard. Check official help docs for exact steps and timing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some users complain about lag or broken features?",
        "answer": "User reports: projects can become unstable or features may stop working without warning. Longer videos may increase stability issues. Try Chrome and ensure a stable internet connection."
