User reports suggest moderation can be strict and generation may stall.",

    },
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Do Freemium videos have a watermark?",
        "answer": "Yes—the Synthesia logo watermark appears on all videos created with a Freemium account. To publish without it, you'll need a paid plan and re-generate the video."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I remove the watermark without paying?",
        "answer": "No—removal requires upgrading and re-generating the video. Exporting the same Freemium video again will still include the watermark."
      },
      {
        "question": "What resolution are standard MP4 downloads?",
        "answer": "Standard MP4 downloads export in Full HD 1080p (1920×1080). This is explicitly stated in Synthesia's download instructions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file formats can I export?",
        "answer": "Synthesia supports MP4, WAV, XLIFF, and captions in SRT and VTT formats. Pick the format based on whether you need video, audio, or localization/captions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I download videos that include interactive elements?",
        "answer": "No—videos with interactive elements cannot be downloaded as MP4. If downloading is required, avoid interactive features in that project."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is commercial use allowed?",
        "answer": "Commercial use is allowed with restrictions, especially around paid promotion when using stock avatars. Paid TV/social ads using stock avatars are listed as not allowed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I get a license to use Synthesia's built-in content?",
        "answer": "Yes—Synthesia states it grants a perpetual license for integrated content used within created videos. This applies to content you include through the platform into your outputs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the system requirements?",
        "answer": "Synthesia requires modern browsers (e.g., Chrome 133+ and Edge 134+) and supported OS versions (Windows 10+ or macOS Catalina 10.15+). If you see issues, confirm your browser version first."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do refunds work?",
        "answer": "Refund rules differ by customer type: terms mention consumers can request a pro-rated refund within 15 days, while help text states purchases are non-cancelable and non-refundable for customers. If refunds matter, confirm whether you're treated as a consumer or business customer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I cancel a subscription?",
        "answer": "Terms describe renewal notice timing (at least 5 days prior for automatic renewal). If you're on annual billing, don't wait until the last day to review renewal status. Check current account UI for exact cancellation steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some scripts get rejected?",
        "answer": "User reports: moderation can be strict and sometimes unclear, leading to rejected scripts. Keep wording neutral, avoid harassment/bullying framing, and remove risky phrasing if blocked."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does rendering sometimes get stuck at 99%?",
        "answer": "User reports: generation can stall near completion and may require retrying. If it repeats, check browser requirements and simplify the project."
