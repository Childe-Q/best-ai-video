      {
        "question": "Do Free plan videos have a watermark?",
        "answer": "Yes—Pika's FAQ indicates videos are still watermarked on lower tiers and for personal use. Unwatermarked video is tied to Pro (and Fancy) subscriptions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which plans allow commercial use?",
        "answer": "Commercial rights are stated as available to Pro or Fancy subscribers. Lower tiers are described as personal use only."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are my videos private by default?",
        "answer": "No—videos are public by default according to the FAQ. Privacy is tied to Pro or Fancy subscriptions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Pika without Discord?",
        "answer": "Yes—the FAQ states you can use Pika on the website. Discord and the website are described as operating independently."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the export resolution (1080p or 4K)?",
        "answer": "1080p claims appear in non-official reviews, and 4K availability is not confirmed in official sources. Verify current plan export specs before upgrading."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do credits roll over month to month?",
        "answer": "Rollover behavior may vary by plan and credit type. If rollover matters, confirm inside the product or official pricing docs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the refund policy?",
        "answer": "The terms state subscription payments are non-refundable, with no refunds for partially used periods. This means you should assume refunds are not available for normal cancellations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel anytime, and when does it take effect?",
        "answer": "Timing (immediate vs next billing cycle) is not confirmed by official sources. User reports suggest the cancellation path can be hard to find."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some users say cancellation is difficult?",
        "answer": "User reports: the cancel button is unclear or missing, and some users say you must switch plans to effectively stop renewal. If you subscribe, locate the billing page immediately and document the steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do generations fail or error out?",
        "answer": "User reports: users see repeated generation failed errors even after paying. Complex scenes may require multiple attempts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file formats can I export (MP4, etc.)?",
        "answer": "Export formats are not clearly confirmed in official sources. Treat MP4 export as unconfirmed until verified in current documentation."

      {
        "question": "Do I own what I create?",
