The trade-off is cost control: credits expire after 30 days, and refunds are discretionary. Free outputs are watermarked; higher export resolutions and commercial rights depend on your plan tier.",

      {
        "question": "Do free users get a watermark on exports?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What export resolution do plans support?",
        "answer": "Official pricing states Free exports at 720p, Creator up to 1080p, and Team up to 4K. Higher resolution availability depends on your subscribed plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do credits roll over to the next month?",
        "answer": "Credits expire 30 days after they are issued, so rollover beyond that window is not supported. Plan billing and issuance timing can still matter for how long you can use them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there any plan with unlimited AvatarIV usage?",
        "answer": "No—official guidance says there is no plan, including enterprise, with unlimited AvatarIV usage and credits. You should expect feature usage to be credit-limited."
      },
      {
        "question": "When does cancellation take effect after I cancel?",
        "answer": "Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle. You typically keep access through the remainder of that cycle."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a refund if I forgot to cancel?",
        "answer": "Refunds are evaluated only under specific circumstances and at the company's discretion. User reports: this can clash with expectations when renewals happen."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Free plan videos commercially?",
        "answer": "The FAQ indicates Free plan usage is non-commercial. Commercial rights for paid plans: Needs verification from official terms or help."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file format do exports download as (MP4, etc.)?",
        "answer": "Export/download documentation needs verification for explicit file format wording. Treat any assumed format as unconfirmed until verified."
